# CaddyChat

CaddyChat is a golf chatbot project designed to assist users with golf-related information. Inspired by Patrick Loeber's series on building chatbots using Python, PyTorch, and JavaScript, this project aims to create an interactive and intelligent chatbot capable of answering golf-specific questions.


## Project Overview

CaddyChat is a Python-based chatbot that leverages PyTorch for natural language processing and machine learning. The chatbot provides golf-related advice and answers to questions such as:

- Golf course recommendations
- Golf tips and techniques
- Player performance analytics
- Other golf-related queries

The frontend of the application is built using JavaScript, providing a simple and intuitive web interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Python
  - PyTorch (for natural language processing and machine learning)
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for processing text data)

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - AJAX for asynchronous communication between the client and server

- **Other Tools:**
  - Flask (web framework for building the API)
  - Git (version control)
